Analyze the current state of the AEGIS codebase and identify valuable improvement opportunities, focusing on the evolution targets GPT2LoRATrainer in 'core/training/gpt2_lora_trainer.py' and HRMTrainer in 'core/training/hrm_trainer.py'. For GPT2LoRATrainer, consider approaches to enhance the model's robustness and adaptability to real-world data variations by incorporating more diverse training datasets and optimizing LoRA parameters for improved convergence. For HRMTrainer, focus on enhancing the model's generalization capability and learning efficiency by introducing data augmentation strategies and experimenting with deeper model architectures. Use the Enhanced Data Pipeline and Model Architecture Optimization strategies to guide your recommendations. Ensure these plans respect constraints such as PreservingTransformerCompat and AdhereToDataConstraints. {context}
