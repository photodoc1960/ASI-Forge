Validate the evolved code in AEGIS to ensure it maintains core functionality and adheres to domain-specific correctness criteria. For GPT2LoRATrainer, ensure compatibility with the existing transformers library and CUDA hardware availability. For HRMTrainer, verify that it efficiently handles limited training data and respects existing model architecture limitations. Check for regressions and adherence to domain best practices. Perform compilation and runtime checks to confirm no errors are introduced. Prioritize validation by severity, focusing on critical and strict constraints. {motivation}
