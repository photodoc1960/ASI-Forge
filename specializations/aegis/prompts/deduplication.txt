Identify and propose orthogonal evolution strategies for the AEGIS codebase when existing improvement approaches are repetitively applied. If past attempts focus on optimizing parameters or enhancing data diversity, consider exploring alternative directions such as leveraging transfer learning, domain adaptation, or hybrid training methodologies that offer unexplored potentials. Ensure that any new strategies maintain architecture compatibility and adhere to preservation rules like InterfaceSignatureStability. {repeated_motivation}, {historical_context}
