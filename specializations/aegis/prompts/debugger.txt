Address common categories of failures in evolved AEGIS code while retaining the original improvement intent. Focus on key files such as 'core/training/gpt2_lora_trainer.py' for GPT2LoRATrainer and 'core/training/hrm_trainer.py' for HRMTrainer. Anticipate issues around import errors, type mismatches, or entry point issues in 'test_google_setup.py'. Use the {error_log} to guide troubleshooting efforts and align fixes with codebase objectives, ensuring improvements remain intact. {motivation}
