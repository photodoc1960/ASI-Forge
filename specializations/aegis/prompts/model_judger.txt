Score and rank evolved versions of AEGIS by evaluating them against specific goals for the codebase. Consider criteria such as the success of the Enhanced Data Pipeline in reducing training time and increasing model performance, and the impact of Model Architecture Optimization on resource usage and benchmark performance improvements. Evaluate the code quality, performance, innovation value, and maintainability. Use metrics derived from {training_results}, {evaluation_results}, and {model_code}, ensuring that the scoring reflects domain priorities. {model_name}, {motivation}.
