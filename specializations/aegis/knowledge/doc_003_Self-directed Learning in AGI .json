  "source": "Research summary: 3. \"self-directed learning in AGI systems\"",
  "design_insight": "The convergence of cognitive architectures, intrinsic motivation, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and hybrid models to enable AGI systems to autonomously identify and pursue learning goals.",
  "experimental_trigger_patterns": "Apply these insights when AGI systems exhibit limitations in adapting to new tasks, struggle with knowledge retention, or require autonomous development capabilities. Performance signs include slow adaptation rate, high dependency on human intervention, or inability to balance exploration-exploitation effectively.",
  "background": "Self-directed learning in AGI was developed to address the need for AGI systems to learn independently with minimal human intervention. Inspired by human cognitive processes, this approach integrates symbolic reasoning with powerful pattern recognition to enable balanced exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety and ethical alignment.",
  "algorithmic_innovation": "Key innovations include the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning, meta-learning techniques like MAML, and self-supervised learning that enables self-labeling of data. Integrating symbolic AI with deep learning assists AGI systems in developing interpretability and adaptability across complex tasks.",
  "implementation_guidance": "Implementations should prioritize data augmentation, robust environment simulations, and integration of novelty detection mechanisms. Key configurations include tuning parameters for reinforcement learning techniques like Upper Confidence Bound, as well as managing memory and resource allocation for continual learning.",
  "design_ai_instructions": "AGI systems should autonomously identify goals by assessing knowledge gaps, balance exploration and exploitation using techniques like UCB, and employ Bayesian methods for decision-making under uncertainty. Avoid overfitting by maintaining diverse training datasets and ensure safety through robust fail-safes.",
