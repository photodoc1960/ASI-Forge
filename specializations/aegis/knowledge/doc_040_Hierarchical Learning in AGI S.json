  "source": "Research summary: 40. \"AGI system architecture focusing on hierarchical learning\"",
  "design_insight": "Hierarchical learning in AGI mimics the human brain by decomposing tasks into simpler subtasks processed at different abstraction levels, using hierarchical reinforcement learning to improve learning efficiency and modular architectures to enhance scalability and adaptability.",
  "experimental_trigger_patterns": "Apply this approach when facing complex tasks that can be broken down into simpler components, particularly when traditional learning methods show high sample complexity, poor exploration strategies, or inefficient scalability.",
  "background": "Hierarchical learning has evolved to address the demands of AGI systems, which require efficient task decomposition and scalability. Techniques like hierarchical reinforcement learning emerged to reduce sample complexity and improve exploration, drawing inspiration from the human brain's layered processing of information.",
  "algorithmic_innovation": "The core innovation includes the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning frameworks like options, MaxQ, and H-DQN, layered architectures for different abstraction levels, and modular design facilitating scalability. Integration of meta-learning with hierarchical structures also allows systems to enhance generalization across tasks.",
  "implementation_guidance": "Use automatic task segmentation algorithms or expert domain knowledge to decompose tasks. Implement multi-layered neural networks with convolutional layers for feature extraction and recurrent layers for decision making. Employ gradient-based optimization and the actor-critic model across layers. Integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic AI using hybrid models.",
  "design_ai_instructions": "Ensure the AI decomposes tasks hierarchically, optimizes learning across abstract layers, and combines symbolic reasoning with data-driven learning. Avoid overfitting by implementing incremental training and ensure the system's decisions are robust and explainable. Continuously adapt the hierarchy based on system performance and emerging requirements.",
