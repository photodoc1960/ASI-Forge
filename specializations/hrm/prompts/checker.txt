instruction: Perform a thorough validation of the evolved HRM codebase components. Ensure that 'convert_single_arc_puzzle' maintains its input-output mapping and handles all known edge cases in 'dataset/build_arc_dataset.py'. Confirm that the 'CastedSparseEmbeddingSignSGD_Distributed' in 'models/sparse_embedding.py' upholds model convergence and compatibility with future model versions. Verify domain-specific criteria, such as no introductions of regressions or errors, and adherence to best practices. {motivation}
