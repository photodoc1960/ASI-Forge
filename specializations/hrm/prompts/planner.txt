instruction: Analyze the current implementation of the HRM codebase with a focus on improving the 'convert_single_arc_puzzle' function in 'dataset/build_arc_dataset.py' and the 'CastedSparseEmbeddingSignSGD_Distributed' class in 'models/sparse_embedding.py'. For 'convert_single_arc_puzzle', devise enhanced data augmentation techniques that are diverse and efficient, considering parallel processing and robust algorithms while maintaining input-output mapping and handling edge cases. For 'CastedSparseEmbeddingSignSGD_Distributed', enhance distributed optimization efficiency using advanced optimization techniques and dynamic learning rate schedules. Provide detailed implementation steps, ensuring alignment with the constraints and goals of the evolution strategies. {context}
