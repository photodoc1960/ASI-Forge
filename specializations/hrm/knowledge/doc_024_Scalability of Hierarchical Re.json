  "source": "Research summary: 24. Scalability of Hierarchical Reasoning Models in AI",
  "design_insight": "Hierarchical reasoning models decompose complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks using layered structures, promoting modularity and reusability. They incorporate different levels of abstraction to efficiently manage large state and action spaces.",
  "experimental_trigger_patterns": "Apply hierarchical reasoning models when encountering tasks with large state-action spaces or requiring complex decision-making. Look for performance bottlenecks, complex task structures, and opportunities for modular learning and adaptation.",
  "background": "Hierarchical reasoning models were developed to handle increasingly large and complex reasoning tasks. By breaking down tasks hierarchically, these models manage complexity and enhance learning efficiency. The approach has roots in systems capable of layered decision-making and task abstraction.",
  "algorithmic_innovation": "Implementation of hierarchical layers where higher layers make abstract decisions that guide lower layers, along with skill acquisition mechanisms and the use of attention mechanisms for managing high-dimensional input spaces.",
  "implementation_guidance": "Use modular architecture and efficient data processing pipelines. Employ techniques like option framework for defining macro-actions, and use skill acquisition and attention mechanisms to focus learning. Optimize interfaces between layers to avoid bottlenecks.",
  "design_ai_instructions": "The AI system should decompose tasks hierarchically and use dynamic hierarchy adaption. Minimize bottlenecks at layer interfaces and use efficient training algorithms like hierarchical actor-critic methods. Ensure transparency in model decisions for explainability and regular evaluations against benchmarks.",
