    "Apply HRM when facing tasks requiring complex sequential decision-making with limited data availability. Suitable for scenarios with high-level abstract planning combined with detailed rapid computations, such as solving complex puzzles or pathfinding in large mazes.",
    "Apply when addressing complex sequential decision-making tasks that require breaking down into sub-problems, and when traditional models struggle with capturing hierarchical dependencies.",
    "Apply these techniques when dealing with complex sequential tasks involving long-term dependencies that require task decomposition and hierarchical execution. Symptoms include difficulty maintaining context across long sequences or sub-optimal task planning.",
    "Apply HRM in scenarios requiring complex decision-making over time, especially when computational resources need to be efficiently allocated across different levels of decision abstraction.",
    "Apply these architectures when facing performance bottlenecks due to long-range dependencies in sequential data tasks, such as language modeling, where context from both past and future is crucial.",
    "Apply hierarchical reasoning models when tasks involve complex decision-making, require multi-level abstraction, or need efficient handling of large state-action spaces. Trigger patterns include inefficient task management, poor adaptability to new contexts, and computational bottlenecks in scaling.",
    "Consider applying HRMs when facing complex problems that can benefit from layered reasoning and decomposition, particularly where different levels of abstraction are required. Look for performance bottlenecks in sequential decision-making tasks where modular and hierarchical approaches can provide clarity and scalability.",
